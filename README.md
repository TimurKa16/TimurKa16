### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Timur Kamalov from Kazan (Russia). I work for a local scientific production association as an embedded systems software engineer since 2019 year.
There I play with different pieces of iron every day: connect them to each other, program, test, deliver and maintain.
Besides irons I talk to people half of my working time (with my student, team, bosses and customers).
Recently, I was instructed a little project with three developers (becoming a teamlead?). Everything flows smoothly (kind of weird).
At work I program in C++. At home I like developing desktop programs in C# for me and other people.

However, the more I work here, the more constraints I get in terms of personal time and traveling (because it's military company).
Now I want to work with hardware less but more with software.
My team is great and I'm happy to work with them (I hope they're, too).
But I want to exit the company and evolve towards web-applications.

A this period of time I'm learning ASP.NET Core and looking for the job in backend direction as a junior/middle C# developer (in Moscow).
In parallel I'm learning HTML, CSS and Javascript to understand my future frontend colleagues or become a fullstack developer.

Well, my dream is to become a teamlead fullstack developer.
