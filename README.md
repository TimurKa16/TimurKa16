### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Timur Kamalov from Kazan (Russia). 

I worked for a local scientific production association as an embedded systems software engineer (2019 - 2022 yy).
Then I wanted to work with hardware less but more with software. 

I knew C# quite well at that time, so I've learned ASP.NET.
Now I'm a backend developer at Finstar Financial Group.



Here I create my portfolio to show my coding style to the world.
I post the most (not all) interesting projects I have developed.
There is a great number of mistakes (not appropriate tools, code repetition and even disguisting naming) because I post the projects not correcting them, 
as they were written 3-4 years ago.
Thus, I want to show to the world: how I grew as developer. And I desire to grow further.

While I post projects, I describe mistakes from the point of view of today's Timur and discuss how I would do it today.
