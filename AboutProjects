Readme

As I said int README.md, I am a C++ embedded systems developer.
And I am looking for a new job as a C# developer in Moscow.

Here I create my portfolio to show my code style to the world.
I post the most (not all) interesting projects I have developed.
There are a great number of mistakes (not appropriate tools, code repetition and even disguisting naming) because I post the projects not correcting them, 
as they were written 3-4 years ago.
Thus, I want to show to the world: how I grew as developer. And I desire to grow further.

While I post projects, I describe mistakes from the point of view of today's Timur and discuss how I would do it today.
